# APEX-0918-Unified-Core-Reporting-Schema
### Disclaimer: 
The introductory clause is strictly informative.
## Introduction 
This schema specification is intended to facilitate the acceptance, recognition and accreditation of the unique media currency provided by airline publishers of streaming media. It may also have applicability to other advertising workflows within the transportation sector.
The normative clauses of this document define a concise subset of VAST 4.0 and VMAP 1.0.1. Every enumerated element and attribute shall be allowed in IFE servers, clients and back-end reporting systems.
## Terms and Definitions
**Optional**  
elements and attributes that are not necessarilly required and may be ignored  
**Mandatory**  
elements and attributes that are generally required in audience impression reports  
**Optional and Not Recommended**  
elements and attributes that are generally considered unnecessary and wasteful of limited resources

Conformance Resources
---------------------

Initial validation of any sample VAST 4.0 XML is relatively straightforward. The
IAB Lab maintains a VAST 4.0 XSD string/file at this [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/vast). A convenient
interactive online validation tool can be accessed at [this web
site](https://vastvalidator.iabtechlab.com/dash) (registration required).

The utility of this document and the express intentions of its contributors
springs from our constraints and prioritizations of the set of VAST and VMPA
elements and attributes we have normatively referenced. Common sense industrial
engineering principles dictate that practical conformance exercises ought to
focus on the specific elements and attributes categorized as mandatory by this
specification.

As of this writing, the APEX 0918 working group continues to collect actual
implementation use cases as well as specific functional requirements from the
airline community. That input will inform ongoing plans to contribute to the IAB
VAST Tag Validator GitHub project.
